# suckless setup

Just dumping my suckless config here so I can easily reinstall it later.

## What's in here?

- **setup.sh**: Script to automate the whole setup. Might need tweaks, but it works for me.
- **Scripts**: Random scripts I use to make my life easier.
- **Configs**: Custom configs for dwm, st, dmenu, etc.

## How to use

I will update this later when I upload the script to my personal website.

## Customize it

Feel free to fork this and tweak it to your liking.

If you have any cool ideas or fixes, open an issue or PR. I'm always down to make this setup better.
