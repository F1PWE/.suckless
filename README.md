# suckless setup

Just dumping my suckless config here so I can easily reinstall it later.

## What's in here?

- **setup.sh**: Script to automate the whole setup. Might need tweaks, I will update as I go.

## How to use

I will update this later when I upload the script to my personal website.


```sh
wget wowmypersonalwebsite.net/setup.sh && sh ~/setup.sh
```


## Customize it

Feel free to fork this and tweak it to your liking. It's all about making it work for you. 

## Contribute

If you have any cool ideas or fixes, open an issue or PR. I'm always down to make this setup better.
